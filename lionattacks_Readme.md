# 🦁 Lion Attacks vs Moonlight Analysis 🌕

## Overview
This project explores the intriguing relationship between moonlight intensity and the frequency of lion attacks. Using real-world data and linear regression modeling, we aim to understand whether lunar phases influence predator behavior.

## 📊 Objective
To model and analyze the correlation between moonlight levels and lion attack frequencies using data science techniques.

## 🔍 Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Sourced from curated datasets provided by Cisco NetAcad.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and structured using `pandas`.
- **Visualization**: Plotted trends and distributions using `matplotlib`.
- **Modeling**: Applied `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn` to quantify the relationship between moonlight and attack frequency.

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- `pandas` – for data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib` – for visualizing data trends
- `scikit-learn` – for building and evaluating the regression model

## 📈 Key Insights
- Preliminary results suggest a potential inverse relationship between moonlight brightness and lion attack frequency.
- Full moon nights may correlate with fewer attacks, possibly due to increased visibility.
