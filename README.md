# Skeleton Variation Project
This project explores variations in the skeletal structures of humans and birds using two datasets.it involves analyzing and answering interesting biological questions using basic data 
filtering and string operations in python (pandas) ---

## datasets used 
-'adult-human-skeleton.csv'-Conatins data of human skeletal bones 
-'bird-neck-bones.csv' -Contains data about neck vetebrae of various bird species ---
## questions explored 
### 1. which bird has the fewest neck vertebrae?
- Filtered the dataset to find the bird with the
  ** minimum number of neck vertebrae**.
### 2. Do humans have more bones in the arms or legs ?
- Compared the number of bones by filtering regions where "arm" and "leg" are mentioned
### 3. how many ribs do human have ?
- Used 'str.contains("rib") to filter rows where bone names contain the word "rib"
- counted total occurences using 'df.shape'.
